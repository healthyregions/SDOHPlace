Beth's work in collaboration with the Erikson Institute for Early Childhood Development in inner-city Chicago Public Schools earned her recognition and a 3-year Kellogg Foundation Leadership Fellowship program. During her Masters in Learning Sciences at Northwestern University, her research focused on using GIS technologies, including ArcView GIS, Google Earth Engine, Google My Maps, and mapping software prototypes under development. Her thesis explored the use of coloration in mapping and cognitive understanding of how maps work. Recently, she was nominated and accepted into the Alliance for Leadership Fellows, an organization that brings graduates of leadership fellowships together to further their development and work collaboratively to \"increase knowledge and skills that lead to equitable and sustainable flourishing within human communities.\" Beth is currently working on developing and reviewing the Climate Action Plan for People and Nature (CAPN) in collaboration with the Chicago Wilderness Alliance (CWA). This effort brings together community partners, including the Field Museum, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, The Technology Alliance, and more to ensure the success of people and nature. She co-taught a high school seminar on Environmental Justice, where she highlighted the importance of prioritizing communities struggling with air and water quality in future climate planning. Her current SDOH and Place project, HEAT (Hope, Education, and ArT), aims to highlight and celebrate art co-created in these communities to build community, connect with nature, and promote healing."
