On December 14th, we'll be having a celebration to promote the 2024 cohort of SDOH & Place fellows!

In order to fill in the gaps from our Spring 2024 cohort, we decided to implement an invite-only fellowship where we invited community organizations to send us members of their staff for the fall semester. We then took these Ambassadors through the community toolkit to create web applications for unique purposes within their organizations! 

During the Celebration, these SDOH & Place Ambassadors will showcase their developing projects.

### Who We Partnered With

\- [Instituto del Progreso Latino](https://www.institutochicago.org/)

\- [People's Response Network](https://prn.mayfirst.info/)

\- [Mujeres Por Espacios Verdes](https://www.womenforgreenspaces.org/)

\- Voces Fieles Comunitarias Contra la Opresión

We will also have guest speakers from our Spring 2024 cohort in attendance as well to present their continuing research and potentially updates to the maps they created as part of the SDOH & Place Toolkit.
