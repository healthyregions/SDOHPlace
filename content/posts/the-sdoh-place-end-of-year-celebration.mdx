On December 14th, we'll be having a celebration to promote the 2024 cohort of SDOH & Place fellows!

In order to fill in the gaps from our Spring 2024 cohort, we decided to implement an invite-only fellowship where we invited community organizations to send us members of their staff for the \[summer and?] fall. We then taught fellows how to create web applications for unique purposes within their organizations. \[Feel like I need something more here about what the fellows did]

\[Maybe some information about the different community orgs. here?]

We'll be live streaming the event here:
