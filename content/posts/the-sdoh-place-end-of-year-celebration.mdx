On December 14th, we'll be having a celebration to promote the 2024 cohort of SDOH & Place fellows!

In order to fill in the gaps from our Spring 2024 cohort, we decided to implement an invite-only fellowship where we invited community organizations to send us members of their staff for the fall semester. We then taught fellows how to create web applications for unique purposes within their organizations. 

Fellows will be presenting the results and implementations of their work throughout the day, and we will also have showcases of the research our SDOH & Place Ambassadors have been undertaking.

\[Maybe some information about the different community orgs. here?]

We'll be live streaming the event here: [go.illinois.edu/EOY-LIVE](http://go.illinois.edu/EOY-LIVE)
