excerpt: Applications for the 2026 SDOH & Place Fellowship are now open! Here we
  will teach you how to create your own data dashboard/data visualization within
  a Human-Centered Design framework!

The SDOH & Place Fellowship is a part-time virtual program of [The SDOH & Place Project](https://sdohplace.org/project), sponsored by the[ Healthy Regions & Policies Lab](https://healthyregions.org/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, with funding in part from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Throughout this program, Fellows will learn how to develop a social determinants of health (SDOH) place-based visualization (e.g., asset map, story map, thematic map, or dashboard) based on a human-centered design (HCD) framework and participatory design principles. Fellows will additionally contribute to the SDOH & Place community toolkit's design, a core component of the SDOH & Place Project.

# Information Session

**When:** Friday, January 23rd, 2026 at 12 PM CST\
**Where:** Virtual, over Zoom. Register Here.

Need help with your application? Come join the virtual information session covering expectations for the SDOH & Place Fellowship in more detail, recommendations for writing your project proposal and how to craft your application, and the expectations of ambassadors of the SDOH & Place Fellowship Program should you get accepted.

Also in this session will be information regarding our new, upcoming, Summer Design Fellowship lead by our Senior Designer, Shubham Kumar! More information on that fellowship **soon to come!**

If you can't make this information session, don't worry! You'll be able to view this year's session on our YouTube after the session is complete: [youtube.com/@healthyregionspolicieslab?si=mj2LE894kFz79lwt.](https://youtube.com/@healthyregionspolicieslab?si=mj2LE894kFz79lwt)

# The Program

This program has six virtual modules that will enhance Fellows' design and technological skills, enabling them to create compelling place-based visualizations using SDOH data. The program features an introduction to human-centered design (HCD) and participatory design principles. HCD and participatory design principles emphasize social and spatial equity by advocating for the development of user-friendly applications in collaboration with the communities that will use them, rather than simply for them. Furthermore, given that a substantial portion of SDOH and place-related data is geospatial in nature, our program highlights essential skills in spatial data wrangling, place-based visualizations, and spatial analysis. Upon completing the program, Fellows will be capable of developing their own application or prototype, which they may potentially refine within the context of their SDOH projects.

Fellows will be introduced to a range of free and/or open source GIS technologies to enhance their design, analysis, and data communication skills. Fellows can choose from technologies that range from no-code options like StoryMapJS and uMap, to those that require coding such as R and MapBox GL, in order to create compelling place-based visualizations to communicate their SDOH findings and health initiatives.

If you'd like to see examples of previous work completed by Fellows of the SDOH & Place Fellowship, you can watch last year's cohort present their prototypes at the 2025 SDOH & Place Project Symposium [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi9Z7UD_p9f8csNaBP_Ni57nJYvUAvonu&si=9Wx2aKr0jkiHgYsB), or read about their work on the Symposium Blogpost [here](https://healthyregions.org/2025/12/19/the-2025-sdoh-place-symposium/).
