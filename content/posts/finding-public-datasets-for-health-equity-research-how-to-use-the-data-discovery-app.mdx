## About the Webinar

Social determinants of health (SDOH) are the conditions in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, & age that affect a range of health outcomes. SDOH datasets are crucial for providing context surrounding community health and helping to understand what factors influence the health outcomes of individuals within that community. However, place-based SDOH data can be difficult to find and difficult to use. It is often split across multiple, siloed, programs and systems that often take years to master, from city data outlets to the national census. Our Solution: the Data Discovery App, created by our team at the SDOH & Place Project. This platform provides access to spatially indexed and curated free databases, specifically designed for conducting health equity research. 

This webinar will walk you through turning a research question into searchable keywords and terms to find data of interest. Also, learn two different routes - Keyword search and AI-assisted search - for how you can use the Data Discovery App to search and find the datasets you need for your health advocacy or research.
