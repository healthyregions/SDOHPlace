## The Data Discovery App

After years of development, we are finally ready to begin testing the SDOH & Place Project’s Data Discovery App! This search engine will act as a one-stop shop for finding free high-quality SDOH data. This tool will allow you to search for data by topic and/or location within rural, urban, and suburban U.S. spaces. Finding data for conducting health equity research will no longer be a challenge with this app! 

### What We’re Looking For

We are asking our SDOH & Place Super Users and professionals within the realm of health equity at UIUC to join us in testing out the data discovery app for the first time! This group will have first access to testing out the app and ensuring its efficacy and ease of use before launch. Super Users will be asked to: 

1. Access the Data Discovery App on their laptop (or similar device)
2. Go through the process of finding social determinants of health data using the Data Discovery tool 
3. Provide detailed feedback on the ease of use of the application
4. Report all bugs, or issues discovered by the user 
5. Provide feedback on how to improve the app prior to its launch later this year

More details about the testing process will be shared during the meeting

#### Not Affiliated with UIUC? 

Be on the lookout for a virtual Super User Meeting following this one! 

### Benefits

Lunch will be provided to all Super Users who attend this meeting. In addition, each Super User will receive a $25 Amazon gift card for their time.

### About the SDOH & Place Project

The SDOH & Place Project provides access to spatially indexed and curated databases, specifically designed for conducting health equity research. We will achieve this goal by:

1. Developing and disseminating a toolkit on integrating User-Centered Design principles in place-based web applications.
2. Creating an innovative product for place-based data discovery to link data needed for app development and related neighborhood health data exploration.

Our mission is to make the process of building web applications that support community health by being more accessible, enjoyable, and empowering.

### About the Team

Our team is based out of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign via Dr. Kolak's Healthy Regions & Policies (HEROP) Lab at the Department of Geography & GIScience, and Dr. Zhai's team at the Department of Computer Science.
