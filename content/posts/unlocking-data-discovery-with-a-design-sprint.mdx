[The SDOH & Place Project](https://sdohplace.org/about) aims to achieve a multitude of goals, one of which is creating a platform that would be designed to provide seamless access to spatially indexed and curated databases specifically for health equity research. For this, we set on a journey to design the Data Discovery platform with a human-centered approach.

To understand the needs of our target audience, we collaborated closely with [an advisory board](https://sdohplace.org/advisory) and a team of local professionals interested in our project we call our Super Users. A key step was identifying and understanding the needs of our user personas: hypothetical individuals who we believe would most benefit from this platform. To visualize their interactions with the platform, we created swim lane diagrams, helping us hypothesize the user flows.

To further refine our understanding, we surveyed professionals involved in public health application design and implementation. This survey delved into contemporary data and design practices, with a particular focus on data visualization and web application development.

### Design Sprint, April 2024

Building upon these insights, we conducted a two-day Design Sprint at the [Siebel Center for Design](https://designcenter.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This sprint brought together a diverse group of talented individuals: current design students and seasoned design professionals from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

To ensure the highest quality of participants, we established a rigorous application process. Applicants were required to specify their design expertise, showcase their relevant experience through their resumes, and express their passion for the project in their cover letters. We sought a diverse range of skills, including expertise in aesthetics/user interface, user experience, usability, functionality, future-proofing, competitor analysis, and market research.

Eleven participants were organized into four dynamic teams, each with three members, except for one team of two. Catalina Alzate, Assistant Professor of Graphic Design at the School of Art & Design served as a mentor throughout the sprint. Christopher Lueg, Professor, and Rachel Adler, Associate Professor, both from the School of Information Sciences, provided invaluable guidance by sourcing participants and evaluating the proposed solutions at the conclusion of the sprint.

The first day of the sprint was dedicated to immersing participants in the project. We introduced them to the carefully crafted user personas, providing rich details about their design interests, influences, goals, needs, expectations, motivations, and pain points. To illustrate existing workflows, we shared the swim lane diagrams. In addition, we invited a previous Super User to share their experiences with SDOH-related platforms.

To foster collaboration and creativity, we divided participants into four teams and assigned each to one of the four user personas we developed, and facilitated a team-building icebreaker activity led by a seasoned design expert. Each team then embarked on a rigorous competitor analysis, culminating in the formulation of three to five "How Might We..." statements to address the identified user needs.
