**Join us this September to build community, spark dialogue, and strike inspiration around the Social Determinants of Health & Place.**

* Wednesday, September 24th - Friday, September 26th
* The Chicago Loop, Illinois

## Overview

The SDOH & Place Project works to build a community of practice around defining & using community-level social determinants of health, and also demystify application design thinking crucial to developing web applications centered on neighborhood health. We have developed a new toolkit to work with place-based SDOH data and develop apps, as well as a new search platform for discovering SDOH data, which launched this March. We’re also building community through discussions on defining SDOH and using SDOH data; engaging new types of collaborations and applications with design justice; and breaking ground in developing new types of infrastructures & tools to support this work.
