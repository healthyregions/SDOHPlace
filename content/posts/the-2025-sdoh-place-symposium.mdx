**Join us this September to build community, spark dialogue, and strike inspiration around the Social Determinants of Health & Place.**

* Wednesday, September 24th - Friday, September 26th
* The Chicago Loop, Illinois

## Overview

The SDOH & Place Project works to build a community of practice around defining & using community-level social determinants of health, and also demystify application design thinking crucial to developing web applications centered on neighborhood health. We have developed a new toolkit to work with place-based SDOH data and develop apps, as well as a new search platform for discovering SDOH data, which launched this March. We‚Äôre also building community through discussions on defining SDOH and using SDOH data, engaging new types of collaborations and applications with design justice, and breaking ground in developing new types of infrastructures & tools to support this work.

## Last Year...

Our inaugural SDOH & Place Fellowship cohort presented their mapping projects that they developed in conjunction with our Community Toolkit and their own organizations. The HeRoP engineering team also previewed our (then in-development) Data Discovery App to excitement and great interest. We also had a great lineup of featured speakers who shared their own insights into SDOH applications, data design, and social justice.
