## The SDOH & Place Fellow Program

\
The [SDOH & PLACE Fellowship](https://sdohplace.org/news/community-fellowship-2024), sponsored by the Healthy Regions & Policies Lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, is a part-time virtual program. It focuses on teaching fellows to develop visualizations related to social determinants of health (SDOH) using human-centered and participatory design principles. Participants also contribute to the design of the SDOH & Place community toolkit.

As a part of this initiative, we also had a call out for Super Users. The HEROP Lab sought participants who regularly use social determinants of health (SDOH) data for research, advocacy, or educational purposes. They aimed to form an "SDOH Super User Group" to understand current practices and challenges in accessing SDOH data, such as socioeconomic, racial, and environmental indicators.

The anticipation has been building, and now the moment has arrived to unveil the talented individuals comprising our *[2024 cohort](https://sdohplace.org/fellows)*. This **dedicated** group is poised to embark on a *transformative journey*, harnessing the power of data visualization to drive positive change in their respective communities.
