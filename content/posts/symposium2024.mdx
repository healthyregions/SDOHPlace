**Join us this June to build community, spark dialogue, and strike inspiration around the Social Determinants of Health & Place.**

* Friday, June 14th - Saturday June 15th
* At the Illini Center, 200 S. Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois

The SDOH & Place Project works to build a community of practice around defining & using community-level social determinants of health, and also demystify application design thinking crucial to developing web applications centered on neighborhood health. We’re developing a new toolkit to work with place-based SDOH data and develop apps, as well as a new search platform for discovering SDOH data. We’re also building community through discussions on defining SDOH and using SDOH data; engaging new types of collaborations and applications with design justice; and breaking ground in developing new types of infrastructures & tools to support this work.

At the **first SDOH & Place Symposium this June**, the community will meet to share progress, break bread, celebrate achievements, and learn from each other. Join us!
