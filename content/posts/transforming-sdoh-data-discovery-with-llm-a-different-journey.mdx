excerpt: We recently released the first version of our SDOH & Place Data
  Discovery platform, a searchable interface for finding and accessing SDOH data
  from many different sources. Inspired by Geoblacklight, a multiinstitutional,
  world-class open-source discovery platform for geospatial (GIS) holdings, we
  implemented this module, a highly customizable data discovery platform with
  Next.js Reach framework, with the search feature powered by Apache Solr, a
  open-source search engine full-text, vector and geospatial search feature for
  document indexing and retrieval. We provide traditional keyword search
  capabilities, allowing researchers to enter terms and find datasets that are
  directly related or relevant to those terms.

We recently released the first version of our [SDOH & Place Data Discovery platform](https://sdohplace.org/search), a searchable interface for finding and accessing SDOH data from many different sources. Inspired by [Geoblacklight](https://geoblacklight.org/), a multiinstitutional, world-class open-source discovery platform for geospatial (GIS) holdings, we implemented this module, a highly customizable data discovery platform with [Next.js](http://next.js) Reach framework, with the search feature powered by [Apache Solr](https://solr.apache.org/), a open-source search engine full-text, vector and geospatial search feature for document indexing and retrieval. We provide traditional keyword search capabilities, allowing researchers to enter terms and find datasets that are directly related or relevant to those terms.

## Traditional Keyword Search Mode

The default search experience functions as most people expect. Users enter specific terms, and the system returns documents containing those exact keywords. This approach works well when users know precisely what they're looking for and the terminology used in most databases.

To save users' time and expand the scope of their searches, we implemented a suggestion feature using Solr’s *suggest* capability. **This allows users to explore related search terms as they type, helping them discover all relevant possibilities available on the platform.** We also developed a recommendation mechanism that presents users with a broader set of results, especially when there are potentially related documents connected to their initial query.

For example, when a user begins typing “food access,” the system will display a list of suggestions, including “Food Access Research Atlas.” By selecting this exact term, the platform returns documents containing that phrase. Users can then refine the results further by applying geographic filters to focus on specific communities.

Similar to many existing term-based search systems, the traditional search mode is highly efficient when users know the exact term they want to search for. **However, it becomes time-consuming and less effective when users are unsure of the precise terminology or when relevant information is described using a different language.**

For instance, a document about “poverty” might be highly relevant but would not appear in results for “food insecurity”. If a user wants to explore a question like “What factors influence food insecurity in the U.S. ?”, they first need to construct multiple search terms—such as “food access,” “economic stability”, and “poverty”. Each of these searches returns a separate set of documents based on exact term matching, requiring the user to perform multiple searches and mentally synthesize the results.

## AI-Inspired Search Mode

Our natural language approach allows users to ask conversational questions such as: 

* "How does public transportation availability affect healthcare utilization in Chicago?" 
* "What are the existing childcare resources in Illinois?" 

The platform uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret users' natural language questions and translate them into precise search queries optimized for the system's underlying search engine. These queries—formulated in a structured format similar to what's used in Solr—capture the intent and context of the original question, enabling the system to understand conceptual relationships across SDOH domains. This allows it to retrieve relevant documents even when they use different terminology from the user. 

The platform also incorporates features like automatic spell correction, sentence reconstruction, and summarization to accurately interpret questions, even when they contain typos or grammatical errors.

**This process retains the detailed query capabilities of traditional keyword search while adding a layer of semantic understanding to deliver more comprehensive results.** We also prompt the LLM to demonstrate the reasoning process to give users insights into how the question is interpreted. Additionally, we enable a highlight feature that allows users to hover over each result card to see which aspects of the data are relevant to their question.
