This book explores how incorporating a spatial perspective enriches the concept of SDoH, lending to the notion of social-spatial determinants of health (SSDoH). Given the multidimensional and intersecting nature of health determinants, a spatial perspective is crucial for defining, measuring, understanding, and operationalizing SDoH. Structural factors that influence population health patterns often leave spatial footprints, such as the legacies of redlining or the placement of vulnerable groups near polluted locales. This volume brings together geographers, sociologists, clinicians, public health researchers, architects, data scientists, and thinkers to provide rich discussions on the current state of the field and visions for the future.
