## App Motivations

Brian created this project, "Uncovering the Factors of Diabetes: A Multi-Level SDOH Analysis Using AI and Geospatial Techniques" for public health research and the advancement of human-centered dashboard design.

## About the App

The data application is a Multi-Level Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Analysis Dashboard for Diabetes Intervention, designed to move beyond traditional clinical measures by integrating AI and geospatial techniques to connect social conditions to health outcomes for more 
targeted and effective public health action.

Brian views four distinct groups as being the target audience for his project.

* Local health professionals who need to quickly identify priority 
  areas for diabetes intervention.
* MPH students seeking to connect 
  Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) data to meaningful, evidence-based 
  solutions.
* Public Health researchers and practitioners who need to translate data insights into academic papers and focused, community-specific actions.
* "The SDOH & Place Project" 
  stakeholders

### **Target Users**
