## App Motivations

Brian created this project, "Uncovering the Factors of Diabetes: A Multi-Level SDOH Analysis Using AI and Geospatial Techniques" for public health research and the advancement of human-centered dashboard design.

The data application is a Multi-Level Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Analysis Dashboard for Diabetes Intervention, designed to move beyond traditional clinical measures by integrating AI and geospatial techniques to connect social conditions to health outcomes for more 
targeted and effective public health action. It features a U.S. National Dashboard that uses AI/Machine Learning to rank the top SDOH predictors, such as food environment and air pollution, to define broad priorities, and a State-Level Dashboard that applies geospatial analysis using Healthy People 2030 measures to pinpoint specific high-burden Illinois counties, shifting the focus to micro, policy-relevant measures to determine where and how to intervene locally. The dashboard is built on a human-centered approach to address user pain points such as data overload by translating complex data insights into clear, actionable decisions.

Brian views four distinct groups as being the target audience for his project.

* Local health professionals who need to quickly identify priority 
  areas for diabetes intervention.
* MPH students seeking to connect 
  Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) data to meaningful, evidence-based 
  solutions.
* Public Health researchers and practitioners who need to translate data insights into academic papers and focused, community-specific actions.
* "The SDOH & Place Project" 
  stakeholders

## Features

1.  Uses AI/ML in a National Dashboard to rank key health predictors.
2. Employs geospatial analysis to pinpoint local intervention areas.
3. Addresses data overload by prioritizing actionable Social 
Determinants of Health (SDOH) indicators.
4. Provides a multi-level approach for broad public health strategy and
 local tactics.
5. Finds highlight specific policy levers for environment and air 
quality.
6. Incorporates various "Community Toolkit" learned through "The SDOH 
& Place Project" to enrich the data application and inform dashboard development and creation.
