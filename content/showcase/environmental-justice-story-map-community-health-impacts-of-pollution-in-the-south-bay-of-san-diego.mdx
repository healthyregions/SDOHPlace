##### *Earlier this year, we invited [fifteen fellows](<>) to develop their own web mapping applications, centered on equity and designed with communities in mind, using the [SDOH & Place Toolkit](<>). From July to September, we'll feature final fellow applications each week.*

## App Motivations

Hannah created her project idea, "Environmental Justice Story Map: Community Health Impacts of Pollution in the South Bay of San Diego" to spread information on the health equity crisis in the South Bay of San Diego.

The goal of this project is to examine the Tijuana River pollution crisis in the South Bay of San Diego and the health equity implications.

The target audience for this work includes the general public, as well as local and state government officials.

## Features

The story map includes both asset maps and choropleth maps from open source data, data from a community survey.
