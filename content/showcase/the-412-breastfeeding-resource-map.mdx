### **App Motivations**

To improve the visibility of resources for families of hospitalized infants in Southwestern Pennsylvania, Jessica and her team created the 412 Breast Feeding Resource Map. 

The 412 Breast Feeding Resource Map is an asset map of perinatal care resources, such as lactation support, doulas, peer groups, and health care providers, around Allegheny County in Southwestern Pennsylvania.

The target audience for this asset map is biological parents of critically ill infants in and around Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.

<br/>

This data application includes the locations of all resources available to breastfeeding and critically ill infants. Each asset has a description of the services offered, contact information, hours of operation, and whether or not community members consider them to be BIPOC and/or LGBTQ+ safe spaces.
