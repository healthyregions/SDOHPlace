## App Motivations

Jacob created his project "HepResourceMap: Hepatitis C Service Sites Locator - City of Los Angeles" to provide a user-friendly visual map 
that seamlessly enables users to locate essential hepatitis C virus (HCV) care sites, including testing, treatment, and harm reduction services. 

HepResourceMap shows the location of hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing, treatment, and harm reduction service sites in the city of Los Angeles. The sites shown in the map were extracted from the CDC National Prevention Information Network database and the HCV resource guide 2025 published by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. 

HepResourceMap aims to support residents of the City of Los Angeles and individuals living with HCV by helping them locate nearby HCV testing and treatment sites, as well as public health agencies, to identify spatial access gaps.

## Features

1. Interactive Interface: Upon launching HepResourceMap, users are greeted with a comprehensive map showcasing all HCV service sites. The intuitive design allows for easy navigation, and when filter options are applied, only the relevant sites are displayed. Users can interactively click on any site to access detailed information, including directions via Google Maps, enhancing the user experience.


2. Filter Options: These enable users to tailor their search for HCV care service sites based on specific criteria. You can filter by the type of services offered, whether it be testing, treatment, or harm 
reduction services. Additionally, you can specify language preferences, such as the availability of Spanish-speaking staff, and check if the site offers free services, ensuring that you find the most suitable care options.


3. ZIP Code Search Functionality: This allows you to input a 5-digit ZIP code along with a designated search radius to effortlessly locate nearby service sites. This targeted approach helps streamline the search process, making it easier for users to find accessible care.


4. Summary Table of Filtered Sites: To further assist users, a table displays the ten closest service sites aligned with your selected filters. This concise summary not only provides vital information at a 
glance but also facilitates quick decision-making in finding the right services.
