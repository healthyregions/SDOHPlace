## **App Motivation**

This dashboard was developed to make spatial inequities in social infrastructure access visible, interpretable, and actionable. Research consistently shows that access to everyday spaces — libraries, parks, and community centers — plays a critical role in wellbeing across the life course. However, these resources are not evenly distributed.

This project bridges the gap between academic SDOH research and the real-world needs of planners, public health professionals, and community advocates.

## **About the Application**

This interactive GIS dashboard maps neighborhood-level access to multiple forms of social infrastructure across the Denver Metro Area using census tract-level data.

The dashboard visualizes:

* Composite and individual social infrastructure measures
* Demographic characteristics including race/ethnicity, age, poverty status, and education
* Spatial patterns of advantage and disadvantage

The interface is designed for exploratory analysis while remaining accessible to non-technical users.

## **Target Users**

Primary audiences include:

* Public health practitioners
* Urban planners
* Policymakers
* Community-based organizations
* Researchers and students
* Community advocates

## **Features**

**Interactive Quartiles Map**
Allows users to select individual census tracts and explore demographic characteristics alongside infrastructure access levels.

**Multi-County Exploration**
Users can analyze counties across the Denver Metro Area including Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, Broomfield, Arapahoe, Adams, and Douglas.

**Layer Comparison Tools**
Users can toggle between social infrastructure types, such as grocery store density and other community amenities.

## **Project Status**

Final version expected Spring 2027.
