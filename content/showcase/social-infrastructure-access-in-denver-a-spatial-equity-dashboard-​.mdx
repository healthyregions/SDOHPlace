  This dashboard is an interactive, GIS-based data application that maps 
  neighborhood-level access to multiple forms of social infrastructure 
  across Denver. Using census tract-level data, the dashboard visualizes 
  composite and disaggregated measures of social infrastructure access 
  alongside key demographic characteristics, such as race/ethnicity, age, 
  percent living below poverty, and percent college educated. The 
  application allows users to explore spatial patterns of advantage and 
  disadvantage, identify areas with high or low concentrations of social 
  infrastructure, and examine how these patterns intersect with 
  neighborhood demographics. The dashboard is designed to support 
  exploratory analysis while remaining accessible to non-technical 
  audiences.

## App Motivations

Hannah created her project, "Social Infrastructure & access in Denver: A Spatial Equity Dashboard" to make patterns of spatial inequity in social infrastructure access visible, interpretable, and actionable. 


Research on social determinants of health and place consistently shows that access to everyday social and civic spaces, such as libraries, parks, and community centers, matters for wellbeing across the life 
course, yet these resources are unevenly distributed across 
neighborhoods. 

Hannah developed this dashboard to bridge the gap between academic research on place-based inequities and the practical needs of 
planners, public health professionals, and community advocates who require accessible tools to understand where gaps in access exist and 
for whom.

The primary target audience for Hannah's dashboard includes public health practitioners, urban planners, policymakers, and community-based organizations working on social determinants of health, neighborhood 
investment, and spatial equity. The dashboard is also intended for researchers and students interested in place-based methods and applied 
GIS, as well as community advocates seeking data to support local knowledge, planning efforts, and resource allocation decisions. By 
combining analytical rigor with an intuitive interface, the application is designed to be useful across research, policy, and practice contexts.

## Features

A key feature of the dashboard is the interactive Quartiles map, which allows users to select individual census tracts and view detailed demographic breakdowns for those areas. This functionality enables users
 to closely examine how demographic characteristics, such as age, 
race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic indicators, align with higher or lower levels of social infrastructure access. By moving beyond citywide 
averages, this feature supports more nuanced, place-specific inquiry and helps users identify inequities that may be masked at broader spatial 
scales.

Users can also zoom in on and explore individual counties within the Denver Metro Area, including Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, Broomfield, 
Arapahoe, Adams, and Douglas counties. In addition, a second tab of the dashboard allows users to examine individual social infrastructure 
categories by viewing density maps (e.g., grocery stores per 1,000 residents, liquor stores per 1,000 residents). Users can toggle between 
layers to compare different types of social infrastructure and better understand how specific amenities are distributed across neighborhoods.
