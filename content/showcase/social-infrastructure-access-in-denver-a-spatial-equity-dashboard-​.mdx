  This dashboard is an interactive, GIS-based data application that maps 
  neighborhood-level access to multiple forms of social infrastructure 
  across Denver. Using census tract-level data, the dashboard visualizes 
  composite and disaggregated measures of social infrastructure access 
  alongside key demographic characteristics, such as race/ethnicity, age, 
  percent living below poverty, and percent college educated. The 
  application allows users to explore spatial patterns of advantage and 
  disadvantage, identify areas with high or low concentrations of social 
  infrastructure, and examine how these patterns intersect with 
  neighborhood demographics. The dashboard is designed to support 
  exploratory analysis while remaining accessible to non-technical 
  audiences.

This week’s featured application explores how access to social and civic spaces shapes wellbeing across neighborhoods and populations.

**By: Mallory Sagehorn**

## **App Motivation**

This dashboard was developed to make spatial inequities in social infrastructure access visible, interpretable, and actionable. Research consistently shows that access to everyday spaces — libraries, parks, and community centers — plays a critical role in wellbeing across the life course. However, these resources are not evenly distributed.

This project bridges the gap between academic SDOH research and the real-world needs of planners, public health professionals, and community advocates.

## 
**About the Application**

This interactive GIS dashboard maps neighborhood-level access to multiple forms of social infrastructure across the Denver Metro Area using census tract-level data.

The dashboard visualizes:

* Composite and individual social infrastructure measures
* Demographic characteristics including race/ethnicity, age, poverty status, and education
* Spatial patterns of advantage and disadvantage

The interface is designed for exploratory analysis while remaining accessible to non-technical users.

## 
**Target Users**

Primary audiences include:

* Public health practitioners
* Urban planners
* Policymakers
* Community-based organizations
* Researchers and students
* Community advocates

## **Features**

**Interactive Quartiles Map**
Allows users to select individual census tracts and explore demographic characteristics alongside infrastructure access levels.

**Multi-County Exploration**
Users can analyze counties across the Denver Metro Area including Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, Broomfield, Arapahoe, Adams, and Douglas.

**Layer Comparison Tools**
Users can toggle between social infrastructure types, such as grocery store density and other community amenities.

## **Project Status**

Final version expected Spring 2027.
