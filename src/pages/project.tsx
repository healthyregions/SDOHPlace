                    Finding data about the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and community
                    context is tough. The data is often scattered, hard to find, and takes time
                    to learn how to use, especially when it involves integrating geospatial data
                    and then transforming for analysis and communications. The SDOH & Place Project
                    was created to make this process easier. A human-centered design approach centers
                    everything we do around the diverse range of people who need access to this
                    critical SDOH data.

                    <br />
                    With a multidisciplinary team, we’ve crafted multiple resources to help researchers
                    and advocates to explore and understand SDOH data and generate high impact research
                    and advocacy centered in health equity. This includes resources like:

                    The SDOH & Place project adopts cutting edge spatial data science to support discovery
                    but at its core, the SDOH & Place Project takes a community-driven approach, focusing
                    on real-world impacts and making sure the process of working with this data and making
                    new data applications is open and inclusive. We prioritize collaboration between the
                    people who collect the data, those who analyze it, and the communities it represents.
                    By simplifying access and building shared understanding, the SDOH & Place Project aims
                    to drive better decisions and more equitable health outcomes.
