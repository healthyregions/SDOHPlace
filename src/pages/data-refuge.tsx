                      In early 2025, there was a widespread effort to remove crucial federal public health
                      datasets in the United States. As researchers, community leaders, and scholars, this
                      has a significant impact on all of our work.
                    </Paragraph>

                    <Paragraph className={'mb-4'}>
                      Fortunately, the SDOH & Place Project team had already earmarked, indexed, and
                      identified critical datasets pertinent to measuring the structural drivers of
                      health in the year prior.
                    </Paragraph>

                    <Paragraph className={'mb-4'}>
                      When the <i>Great Purge</i> began, the team extracted multiple datasets at risk of being lost,
                      in collaboration with colleagues across the state of Illinois, and has since
                      linked multiple datasets to the SDOH Search Discovery Platform. The University of
                      Chicago Library team, as an early collaborator, developed additional metadata for
                      the data, and colleagues from a central Illinois health system further supported
                      efforts by identifying and downloading critical measures.

                      Our current approach to identifying, organizing, and sharing previously publicly-available
                      SDOH data across federal systems is informed as researchers who regularly use the data
                      for analyses. Thus on the Box site, screenshots of webpages are preserved in many
                      cases as are technical documentations, when available and accessible. We know that
                      data means more with context, so linking the metadata and related documents is crucial
                      to the work.
